# Allows running kubescape cluster security scanning manually, via the tilt ui.
# The point is simply to move security upstream, into the development loop.
# The scanner scans the cluster from the host, assuming k3d has setup kubeconfig as required by kubescan for the command below.
# Security scanning is effectively just linting, and should be integrated into a build process as such.
# Allowing the developer to run the scan manually is just easier to maintain/describe for this project.
