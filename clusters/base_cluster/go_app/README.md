TODO: a how-to-run may be nice here, but am not sure where the readme for this app
ought to live. The bad: info about this app may exist at multiple levels/locations,
the repo root as well as here. Either way, this is behind because the instructions
for running it under istio (the current default) are scattered as well. To find this
info, grep for "goapp.dev" from the repo root.
