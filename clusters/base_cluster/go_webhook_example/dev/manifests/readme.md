These are raw/static K8s yamls to demonstrate a webhook, and
likely to fall out of date or out of scope for the repo. They
will be kept for example purposes.

In real production, this should instead be a helm chart,
but it entails quite a lot of complexity to ensure that tilt
builds all of the dependencies in the correct order. Not difficult,
just tedium I don't need for the purposes of a simplified example.
