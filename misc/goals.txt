Goals are not hard and fast, nor ranked.

But, to quote all of my passive-aggressive NW upbringing, 'it would be nice if':
* Complete full cloud-stack responsibilities. There are plenty of missing
  real-world requirements. See the first chapters of most any cloud-dev book, 
  such as Cloud Native Go:
    * logging and something like logrus
    * monitoring/metrics
    * comprehensive security shrinkwrapping (a massive undertaking, but worthy of a winter project)
    * practical DevOps workflows and management:
        * tooling for updating apps
        * db migrations
* A minimalist full stack cloud deployment: same as previous, but minimalist, e.g. 'what would fit on a
'raspberry pi cluster' or something similar.
