Various code fragments in this folder are from Dmitri Nesteruk's Golang Design Patterns course: https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-go/

No plagiarism is intended, I merely mixed my own notes and other lit as I took the course.

I highly suggest Dmitri's course. Design patterns are the path to metaglot software as opposed to polyglot. Golang's opinionated stance on composition, d.i., interface satisfaction, and concurrency primitives dovetails very nicely with higher level engineering principles and design patterns.
